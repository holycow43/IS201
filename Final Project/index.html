                        <p>I am a passionate learner, creative thinker, and innovative leader. I am currently a student at Brigham Young University, applying to the Marriott Business School at the end of spring semester. I work as an analyst at Brigham Capital covering the consumer sector and researching potential stocks the fund can invest in. I also mentor eight teams for BYU's On-Campus Internship program as a teaching assistant. I am exploring investment banking and corporate finance as potential career paths. This summer I will be working for AgReserves in the Tri-Cities area as an accounting intern.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">This past semester, I had the opportunity to work on a case competition with Walmart about the brand's premium service, Walmart+.</span>
                        
                        <p>I decided to pursue the finance route for a few key reasons. For one, I believe that the major prepares students with valuable skills that employers look for: analytical thinking, a strong background with numbers for financial planning, budgeting, and other financially-related skills, a strong background in Excel, and the ability to work collaboratively in a team environment. Additonally, I have been enrolled in many business courses this past year and I am loving the information that I am learning. However, one of the biggest reasons I chose to pursue finance was because of how heavily male-dominated the field is. I believe it is important that women have a stronger standing in business because our insights and perspectives are valuable. I am the VP of Marketing for BYU's Women in Finance Association. This role specifically has taught me how important it is for women to know that their voices deserve to be heard, especially in a business setting.</p>

                        <p>When I am not overloaded with homework or cramming in my last-minute studying before a midterm, I love to rock climb, work out, and sing. My favorite artist is Taylor Swift [I worship the ground she walks on]. I love the outdoors and I am in constant awe of the beautiful mountains right next to BYU's campus!</p>
                        <p>I call myself a Wisconsite but I have also lived in Oregon, Alabama, Texas, and Utah. When I graduate I hope to live in a bigger city, probably on the East Coast. Long-term, I'm not sure where I want to settle down. I've loved living in a variety of different places growing up.</p>
